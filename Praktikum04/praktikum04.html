        <section><p>He asked his No.6, N'Golo Kante, to switch positions with the wing-back, putting James and his physical presence closer to the box and moving the France international out wide. 

            That change, along with the substitutions of Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Ross Barkley, upset Newcastle's physical, defensive set-up.
            
            The net result was that James was given even more time and space to show off his finishing skills, which was just as well, given the likes of Hakim Ziyech and Havertz are still struggling to locate the back of the net.
            
            "Maybe I should try them as wing-backs," Tuchel quipped afterwards.
            
            Even before kick-off, Tuchel had been acknowledging the importance of his wing backs in his 3-4-3 formation, which has inspired such an upturn in Chelsea's form since his appointment as Frank Lampard's replacement in January.

            <section><p>"For Reecey, we have to encourage him to trust himself to arrive in the box and be dangerous because he can be a real threat positionally but also technically.

                "There have been some fantastic goals, against Arsenal and against Norwich. The finishing and the technical ability has been brilliant but they still need to feel their way into it, to understand the game and know when they have to arrive in the box and when they have to provide protection around the box.
                
                "The more they understand it, the more natural it becomes. The less they think about it, the better it gets. But I'm happy with everybody. Marcos was very strong at the beginning. Chilly is now very strong. Reecey, very strong."
